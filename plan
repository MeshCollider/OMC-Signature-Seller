This is what I have so far. It's rough but it's on the right track. Normally once I begin coding things come together better. The only thing I haven't done is figured out the OMC IPN part. So that once a payment is made on an approved sale the IPN will kick in.


Plugin for OMC based Signature Purchases
----------------------------------------------

The IPN function I have not yet figured out the best way to automate.

---------------------
/buysigs.php (page for buying and selling of sigs)

actions: 
buysigs.php?action=sell (sellers can set price per day)
buysigs.php?action=do_sell
buysigs.php?action=buy&uid=XXX (view seller listing)
buysigs.php?action=do_buy&uid=XXX* (after buy the seller gets a PM to "accept" action the purchase)
buysigs.php?action=listings (will show all listings of seller with username (format_name+profile link) , posts, reputation on page)
buysigs.php?action=accept 
buysigs.php?action=do_accept

Make sure all post data is verified and that signatures are cleaned. Use standard Mybb functions please.


-------------------------
/inc/tasks/buysigs.php (Task to check the expired date of sold sigs and replace them to original sig)

-----------------------------
/inc/plugins/buysigs.php

Plugin file will insert database tables required.
Add function to prevent an active status sold signature to be altered.


----------------------------
Database Scheme:

Table Name:sigsales (for the listing of sales)
Columns:
id
uid
price (in omc of course)
length (will be sold in days)
status (0=open listing, 1=sold, 2=expired)

Table Name: sigbuys (for the sales, saving and replacing of sigs)
Columns:
id
uid_seller
uid_buyer
oldsig
newsig
status (0=active, 1=expired)
buydate (use unix dateline time)
expdate (use unix dateline time)
txnid (omc sales transaction id)
